    <p>8a.create an object representing a basketball product: product name is basketball, price of 2095 cents 
    8b. Increase the price by 500 cents  ( use dot notation to increase the price and display the updated object in the console )
    <br>
    8c. Using bracket notation, add a property 'deliver-time' to the object with the value '3days'. Display the updated object in the console
    <br>
    8d.Create a function 'comparePrice(product1,product2,)'which takes 2 products (with 'name' and 'price properties ') and returns the product that is less expensive. Create 2 products and try out the function 

    <br> 
    8e. Create a function 'isSameProduct(product1,product2)' which  returns true if the 2 products have the same values inside ('name' and 'price'). If not, return false. Create 2 products and try out the function. (Hint: Objects are references so you can't compare them directly).
    
    <br>

    8f. Using Google or an A.I  tool, search how to convert a string to all lowerCase with javascript ('Good Morning'=>'good morning')

    <br>

    8g. Search how to repeat a string many times ('test' 2 times => 'testtest')

    <br> 
    8h. We'll add localStorage to the calculator project. First, make a copy of the the project
    - whenever we update the calculation, save it using .setitem()
    -when the page first loads, the calculation using .getItem()
    -use a default value of '' if a calculation doesn't exist in local storage
    <br>

    8i. Well improve the coin flip game 
    - create 2 buttons to play the game(heads, tails)
    - when clicking 'heads' play the game with guess = 'heads'
    -when clicking 'tails' play the game  with guess = 'tails'. 
    -create a function 

</p>

<script>

    /*Math.max(34,45)
  //console.log(calculation)
  
  if (true){
    console.log("hello")
  }
  
  function addFive(number){
    let result;
    if(number%2!==0){
      result = number +5;
      return result
    }else{
      console.log("number is not divisible by 2")
    }
  }

  
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*6)+5);

console.log(addFive(15)) */
