    <h1>Boolean/if-statements Exercise</h1>

    <P>create a variable called hour and save the current hour of the day(use 24hours) 
        if hour is between 6 and 12 display: good morning.
        if hour is between 13 and 17 display good afternoon
        otherwise display goodnight in the console. 
    <br>
    Create a variable name and save your name inside a string. update the if statement above to display your name i each message : Good morning "Sherlyne"
    <br>
    (6d)
    Imagine an park with discount for children (6yrs and younger or seniors 65yrs and older)
    - create a variable age and save a persons age. Create an if-statement the checks if the person qualifies for a discount: if they do display discount otherwise no discount. 
    Not try to use (||)
    <br>
    (6e)
    continue from (6d)
    discount is only available if its not a holiday. create a variable : const isHoliday = true; 
    update the code so that in order to get a discount people must meet the age requirement and is also not a holiday.
    Note:&& has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets to control which code gets done first. Nb try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages. 

    Challenge: Try using the ternary operator(Condition?A:B)

    </P>

   const hours=20; 
   const name = 'Sherlyne' 
   let display = '';

        if(hours>6 && hours<12){
            display = `Good morning ${name}!`;
        }else if(hours>13 && hours<17){
            display = `Good afternoon ${name}!`;
        }else{
            display =`Good night ${name}!`;
        }

    console.log(display)

    /* Ternary operator
    const newHours = 6<hours<12? `good morning ${name}`: 13>hours<17? `good afternoon ${name}` :`Goodnight ${name}`;
    console.log(newHours)*/
    
    

    // AGE:

    console.log(ageDisplay)*/

    // ternary operator 
    const discountTime = isHoliday && (age<=6 || age>=65)?`Discount`:`No discount`

    console.log(discountTime)
